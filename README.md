# Health Tracker App

This app allows users to set health categories they want to track.
Every night it will send a notification to enter how healthy the user was in their set categories, good, neutral, or bad, as well as add a text summary.
Users can then scroll through their entries for different days and see how their personal health has been in their set categories.
